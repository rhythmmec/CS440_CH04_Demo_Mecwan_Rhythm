I used the BSD 2-clause license for my repository becasuse it is the simplified BSD License. It omits the non-endorsement clause. It also adds a further disclaimer about views and opinions expressed in the software. The following rights are granted: Copyright granted, Right to Perform, Right to Display, Right to copy, Right to modify, Right to distribute under same licesnse, and Right to sublicense. Because there are so many rights granted with this license, I chose this license to use. I personally prefer BSD licenses because programmars can maintain more of the freedom with what they are allowed to di with the direvative code. To summarize, I prefer to use the BSD 2 license because of the simplification and because it is conducive to liberating people.
